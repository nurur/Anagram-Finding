AnagramFinding-R.vs.Python
===============

Anagram of a word that contain the same set of letters of a given word. 
The letters in the anagram and in the word appear in different orders  
 
Noe that the way the codes are written there should be no word within the 
string that can have an apostroph! To avoid this either remove it or put 
a backward slash (\) before apostroph such as "change: world's to world\'s". 

If the input string is a sentence including articles or prepositions, the 
present code treats them as anagram. An improved version of the codes will 
be added later.
